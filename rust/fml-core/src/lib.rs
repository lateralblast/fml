//! Fix Media Language: change the default audio and subtitle tracks and languages of
//! media files.
//!
//! MKV files are edited with `mkvpropedit` where possible (only the metadata changes)
//! and rewritten with `mkvmerge` when tracks are moved or removed. MP4 files are
//! rewritten with `ffmpeg` (a copy of the streams, so nothing is re-encoded). AVI files
//! have no track metadata to edit, so they are only rewritten, to swap or remove audio
//! tracks.
//!
//! This crate does the work and prints nothing: a front end (the command line or the
//! GUI) gives it a [`Config`] and an event sink, and shows what it is told.
